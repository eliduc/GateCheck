## üöÄ Usage

### Run Individual Programs:

**Big gate monitoring with control:**
```bash
python GateCheck.py
```

**Small gate monitoring (read-only):**
```bash
python GateCheckSmall.py
```

**Web interface (all devices):**
```bash
python Online_check_web.py
```
Access web interface at: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`

**Note:** All programs can run simultaneously as they serve different purposes.

### Test Individual Components:
```bash
# Test Shelly switch control
python ControlSwitch.py

# Test Telegram messaging
python TelegramButtonsGen.py
```

## üåê Web Interface Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of all devices via Server-Sent Events
- **Mobile responsive** design for phone/tablet access
- **Interactive gate control** with status feedback
- **Color-coded status**: Open (red), Closed (green), Offline (red)
- **Battery level display** for gate sensors
- **Network access** from any device on local network

### Web Interface Setup
1. Configure Windows Firewall to allow port 8000
2. Access from any device: `http://COMPUTER_IP:8000`
3. Interface automatically adapts to mobile devices

## üè† Home Assistant Setup

### Required Sensors:
Your Home Assistant must have the following entities configured:

**For gate sensors (example with Xiaomi Aqara):**
- `binary_sensor.big_gate_sensor_opening` - Big gate door sensor
- `sensor.big_gate_sensor_battery` - Big gate battery level
- `binary_sensor.small_gate_sensor_opening` - Small gate door sensor  
- `sensor.small_gate_sensor_battery` - Small gate battery level

### Entity Naming Convention:
The system automatically derives battery sensor names by:
- Replacing `_opening` with `_battery`
- Changing `binary_sensor.` to `sensor.`

### Long-lived Access Token:
1. Go to Home Assistant ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Long-lived access tokens
2. Create new token
3. Copy token to configuration files

## üì± Telegram Bot Setup
1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Create new bot with `/newbot`
3. Get bot token and your chat ID
4. Add credentials to configuration files

## üîß Hardware Setup

### Gate Sensors:
- **Recommended**: Xiaomi Aqara door/window sensors
- Must be integrated with Home Assistant
- Battery reporting capability required

### Shelly Switch (Big Gate Only):
- **Model**: Shelly 1 Plus or compatible
- Connected to gate motor control
- Accessible via local network IP

### Network Requirements:
- All devices on same local network
- Home Assistant accessible from monitoring computer
- Shelly device accessible via HTTP

## üìä Monitoring Features

### Gate Status Detection:
- **Real-time monitoring** of open/closed states
- **Battery level tracking** with two-tier alerts
- **Automatic retry logic** for failed operations

### User Interaction:
- **Telegram buttons** for manual control decisions
- **Web interface buttons** for immediate gate control
- **Configurable delays** for different scenarios

### Error Handling:
- **Robust network error recovery**
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting
- **Graceful degradation** when services unavailable

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local operation** - no cloud dependencies after Tuya migration
- **Network security** - all communication within local network
- **Token protection** - never commit real credentials to repository
- **Firewall configuration** - controlled access to web interface

### Security Best Practices:
- Use strong Home Assistant passwords
- Regular token rotation recommended
- Monitor network access logs
- Keep software dependencies updated

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Home Assistant Connection:**
- Verify HA IP address and port (default 8123)
- Check long-lived access token validity
- Ensure HA is accessible from monitoring computer

**Entity Not Found:**
- Verify entity names in Home Assistant
- Check battery sensor naming convention
- Ensure sensors are properly integrated

**Web Interface Access:**
- Configure Windows Firewall for port 8000
- Verify computer IP address with `ipconfig`
- Check if web service is listening with `netstat -an | findstr :8000`

**Telegram Issues:**
- Confirm bot token and chat ID
- Test bot independently with TelegramButtonsGen.py
- Check network connectivity to Telegram servers

**Shelly Control:**
- Verify Shelly IP address and network connectivity
- Test manual HTTP requests to Shelly API
- Check Shelly device status and configuration

## üîÑ Migration from Tuya
